## LQCD Visualization

**`Lqcd_Visualization_III.py`** visualizes the output of a lattice QCD simulation derived from `lattice_qcd.f90`. It takes two files as input:

* `fermion_fields.txt`: This file contains the fermion field data generated by the Fortran program.
* `gauge_fields.txt`: This file contains the gauge field data generated by the Fortran program.

The code then uses Plotly to create two 3D scatter plots:

* **3D Visualization of Fermion Fields:** This plot shows the real part of the fermion field (Ïˆ) at each lattice point. The points are colored according to the value of the real part of psi, with a Viridis colormap.
* **3D Visualization of Gauge Fields:** This plot shows the real part of the gauge field (U) at each lattice point. The points are colored according to the value of the real part of U, with a Plasma colormap.

This will generate **two** separate plots in your web browser, visualizing the fermion and gauge fields from the simulation data.
